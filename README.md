# Xpsychology


This app allows you to get an accurate insight about a X (Twitter) profile. So useful to hire somebody, because of we know how annoying is to fake your likes in your X. Almost everybody likes what he actually likes

Sure, a like doesnt mean he actually believe or agree with that, but is a way to understand the user´s mind. Why does he likes that stuff in his free time ? is he left or right wing ? i dont wanna people with that ideology. 

Likes of people says a lot ! 


Goals :

* Our first mission is to get the user´s ideology. That says a lot to a recruiter that is hiring.
