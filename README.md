# Xpsychology


This app provides deep insight into a user's mindset through their X (formerly Twitter) profile. It's especially useful for recruitment, since it's hard to fake what someone genuinely likes on X. Most people engage with content that reflects their true interests.

Sure, a "like" doesn’t always mean full agreement — but it reveals something about what resonates with them in their free time. Why does this person engage with that kind of content? Are they left-wing or right-wing? Do they hold views that align with your company culture?

Likes say a lot.

Goals:
Our primary goal is to infer the user's ideological leaning. This is highly valuable for recruiters, as it offers a deeper understanding of a candidate beyond their résumé.
